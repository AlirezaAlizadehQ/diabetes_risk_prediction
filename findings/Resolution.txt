The graphs might be small in your system 
and that is because of the different 
screen resolution of my machine and the IDE I used(VSCode). 

I noticed them after I rendered the project and 
saved all the graphs. 


PS: (In order to change the size of graphs, I had to re-run
all the notebooks. But the training time was far long.)

Thank you for your consideration.
